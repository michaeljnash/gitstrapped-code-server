so we can disable extension installation for the user or not in policies (if disabled just change the chown so installs fail and maybe make proxy show a nicer message when we try installs!)

then we can basically know for sure that any installed are only our own, or we can (re)install all of our own on each init/strap run plus whatever user has installed. we should also add a way to do versions later specific ver installs from .profile.json extensions array

prevents us having to do any uninstall all missing none install all missing none stuff making things much easier. makes more sense as a policy anyway to allow/disallow extensions install etc. later we can figure out how to do a enable/disable policy

so we can install the superset of extensions on each init/strap run and then we with our proxy, per profile on load, find the specified extension id's for that profile, and copy the object from the config/extensions/extensions.json with the same id and copy it to the config/data/User/profiles/extensions.json in the array there, thus adding that extension to the profile.

BOOM, we have extensions per profile all figured out. copying settings keybindings tasks etc all easier so figure that out next.
